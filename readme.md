<!-- PARTICLE TEMPERATURE -->
Raihan Alfaridzi - 31 August 2022

Python function for calculating local temperature of an atom, using ovito library. The local temeperature of an atom is defined as the average kinetic energy inside a sphere of radius $R_cut$ as

$$T_a=\frac{1}{3 N k_B}*\[ \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i v_i^2 = 1 \]$$
